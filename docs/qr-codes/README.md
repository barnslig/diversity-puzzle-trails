# QR Codes

This chapter provides all technical details on how the QR codes are encoded.

The following assumptions are made:

- **New**: QR codes only contain a reference to the actual actions
- Every QR code can trigger >= 1 actions, i.e. one code may trigger multiple actions
- Actions from a QR code are processed in order
